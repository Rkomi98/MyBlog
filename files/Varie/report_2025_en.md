# AI Report 2025: What Really Changed

## Abstract

In 2025, GenAI stopped being just ChatGPT and only used to answer "simple" questions. Instead, it enabled many other things: from research across hundreds of sources with "agentic" browsers, IDEs working alongside developers, and open/local solutions becoming truly competitive. This article reconstructs key releases month by month, compares the main players, and concludes with practical lessons and the most probable trends for 2026.

This report tells the story of 2025 **in a very practical way** from the perspective of someone who, until a year ago, was a student, and now focuses on bringing GenAI and its applications to companies: what was released, what truly changed habits, and which companies "brought home" concrete results.

## Method: How I Verified the Dates

- When possible, I used **official announcements** (company blog/press release).
- When a single announcement does not exist (e.g., gradual rollouts), I used **solid journalistic sources** and indicated the "staggered" nature.
- In the timeline, you will always find: **When** (date) and **Source** (code [Fxx] → complete list in appendix).

## 2025 Timeline (Complete and Explained)

Mini-legend "from people":
- **"Pro / top" models**: you call them when you need to *truly understand* (long reasoning, difficult decisions, delicate code).
- **"Flash / fast" models**: you call them when you need to *handle volume* (summaries, classifications, triage, customer care, small repetitive automations).
- **"Open / local" models**: you choose them when **control, costs, privacy** matter, and you want them to run close to your data.
- **Tools (search, IDE, browser with pilot, app creators)**: this is where 2025 truly changed habits: not just "talking," but **completing tasks**.

## Focus: AI in Space (2025)

In 2025, the keyword in space is not "science fiction," it's **autonomy**. The reason is simple: when you're in orbit (or beyond), communication is costly and delayed. Therefore: more software capable of deciding and adapting on board means a more efficient mission.

### USA — more operational autonomy and more data discipline

- **U.S. Space Force: Data & AI Plan FY2025**
  - When: **March 19, 2025**
  - What it signals: AI is not just a “model,” it’s **organization**: shared data, literacy, tools, governance.
  - Source: **[F31]**

- **Satellites that decide “if it makes sense to capture”**
  - When: **July 25, 2025** (account of a public demo/test)
  - What it signals: part of the intelligence moves onboard: less “download everything to Earth,” more “choose and filter first.”
  - Source: **[F32]**

*(Note: many NASA/DoD activities are continuous and do not always have a single “launch” date. In this section, I have only included points where a public date is explicit.)*

### China — In-Orbit Computing and Constellations Processing Onboard Data

- **Launch of a “space computing constellation” (initiative led by Zhejiang Lab)**
  - When: **May 15, 2025**
  - What it signals: push towards a network of satellites that **process data directly in orbit**, reducing transfers to Earth.
  - Source: **[F33]**

### Europe — Reliability, Interoperability, “Serious” Earth Observation

In 2025, Europe tends to move with a more “engineering” approach: less show, more verifiability.

- **ESA Φ‑lab / AI4EO (AI for Earth Observation)**
  - When: **ongoing initiative (active in 2025)**
  - What it signals: focus on AI applied to Earth observation (climate, ice, agriculture, risks).
  - Source: **[F34]**

## An Important Note: Those Who Invested Much But Gained Little

In 2025, a recurring pattern was observed (applicable across all sectors):
1) **Eternal Pilot**: Great POCs, but no one brings them to production.
2) **Disordered Data**: duplicates, confused permissions, non-standard processes → the assistant doesn't “understand” because the company isn't legible.
3) **Unmeasured Quality**: without metrics (errors, times, savings, risks), adoption remains emotional and then fades.
4) **Vague Governance**: who can use what? with which data? who signs off on the output? if no one decides, no one scales.

The difference between those who won and those who lost in 2025 was almost always here: **processes + data + responsibility**, rather than “the newest model.”

**Story of the year:** less hype, more real plans and experiments.

### xAI — **7.2/10**
**Story of the year:** strong on real-time, less on complete work processes.

## Conclusion: Discoveries of 2025 and What to Expect in 2026

### The 5 Key Discoveries of 2025
1) Research has become a full-fledged job: you don't ask for "a link", you ask for "a report".
2) The office shifts to the browser: if the browser can act, many tasks become faster.
3) Coding changes pace: more rapid iterations, less time on repetitive tasks.
4) Hype is not enough: process, clean data, and quality metrics are needed.
5) Efficiency and accountability matter as much as power: costs, energy, error control.

### Probable Trends for 2026
- Tools that work in blocks of **30–120 minutes**, not in single-response bursts.
- More autopilots within existing software (browsers, office suites, IDEs).
- Prices and metrics tied to outcomes (and operational cost), not just to tokens.
- More attention to quality and security, especially in companies and public administration.
- More 'local' execution where possible, for costs and privacy.
